## ⚡ What Swund Does
- Real-time multi-chart interface inside a Farcaster mini app  
- AI assistant (powered by Grok / Claude / onchain LLMs) delivering live market analysis & signals  
- One-tap onchain trading using Celo WalletKit + Social Connect  
- Social trading: follow top traders, see their casts + P&L onchain  
- Token discovery with Farcaster sentiment & onchain volume overlays  
- Fully decentralized — no custodians, no KYC, no withdrawal delays

## 🧩 The Problem It Solves
Current trading experiences on Farcaster are fragmented:
- Most Frames are gimmicks, not real trading tools  
- Centralized apps feel out of place in a social feed  
- High fees and slow chains kill mobile trading momentum  

Swund fixes this with a **native, fast, social, AI-first trading terminal** that lives where the alpha already flows — inside Warpcast, powered by Celo.
